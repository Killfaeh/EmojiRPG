Emoji RPG is a tiny game I have developed to practice coding with the Swift language.</br>
The game just involves walking around a randomly generated map.</br>

Actually, the real game is not what the program does, but trying to understand the source code.</br>
As I discovered that Swift supports emojis in variable, function and class names, I thought it would be fun to write a program all in emojis. ðŸ¤ª</br>
I've deliberately removed all the comments to make the challenge tougher. ðŸ˜›</br>
So I strongly recommend that you consult the source code. It's the most fun part, even if you're not a developer.</br>
