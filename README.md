## Introduction

Emoji RPG is a tiny game I have developed to practice coding with the Swift language.</br>
The game just involves walking around a randomly generated map.</br>

Actually, the real game is not what the program does, but trying to understand the source code.</br>
As I discovered that Swift supports emojis in variable, function and class names, I thought it would be fun to write a program all in emojis. 🤪</br>
I've deliberately removed all the comments to make the challenge tougher. 😛</br>
So I strongly recommend that you consult the source code here : [Source code directory](https://github.com/Killfaeh/EmojiRPG/tree/main/Sources). </br>
It's the most fun part, even if you're not a developer.</br>

## Installation

blablabla

## How to play

If you're running the game for the first time, right-click on the EmojiRPG file and click on “Open”. </br>
A popup will appear telling you that the developer is unknown and asking if you want to open the program anyway. </br>
Click on the “Open” button.</br>

A developper has to pay a subscription fee to Apple to get rid of this warning popup. </br>
I have no desire to spend $99 a year on a tiny program like that. Sorry. x) </br>

If you've already run the game in the past, all you need to do is double-click on the EmojiRPG file.</br>

Ensuite, après quelques seconde d'initialisation, l'écran d'accueil apparait. </br>
Then, after a few seconds of initialization, the home screen appears. </br>

### Controls

The game runs only with keyboard, no mouse or game pad.

1. Navigate in menus and walk in the map : arrows keys
2. Validate a choice : enter
3. Cancel or display pause menu : escape
